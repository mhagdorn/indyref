This repo contains a bunch of python scripts that I have written to explore
the often hear assertion that Labour would have no chance running the rUK 
and that the Tories would be in power for evermore. A similar statement was
that should Scotland become independent then the chances of the rUK leaving
the EU in the case of an in/out EU referendum would increase.

Scotland is roughly 10% of the total population - to be precise in the 2010 
general elections 8.3% of the total number votes in the UK were Scottish.

I have scraped the election data from http://electionresources.org/uk/
